                                <P>Ayo Mungut Sampah (AMUTS) is an application that was initiated by the awareness of
                                    the waste problem that is damaging the environment around us. Polluted rivers and
                                    clogged sewers are the background of this app. The impact is felt with the emergence
                                    of mosquitoes in the neighbourhood, as well as the health problems of the affected
                                    communities. AMUTS aims to increase public awareness in disposing waste properly,
                                    especially in landfills, by offering incentives in the form of financial rewards.
                                </p>
                                <p>The AMUTS application was developed using Javascript programming language with NextJs
                                    framework and Tailwind as its CSS styling tool. MongoDB database is used to store
                                    and manage incoming data. This project implements RestAPI which allows users to
                                    login using their GitHub account. In developing this application, my focus was on
                                    the backend and operational management (DevOps). Features include an admin login
                                    feature, as well as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functions that allow
                                    efficient data management.</p>

                                <P>Our DevOps project aims to improve the efficiency and performance of KarsaJobs and
                                    Ecommerce applications. We use Kubernetes as the main platform for application
                                    deployment and management. The application deployment process is done through
                                    container management with images uploaded to GitHub Packages, ensuring availability
                                    and efficient management.</p>
                                <p>We automate testing using Jenkins, ensuring any code changes are thoroughly tested
                                    before deployment in the production environment. Jenkins helps us identify and fix
                                    potential issues before they reach end users. Additionally, we use Prometheus to
                                    monitor application performance in real-time, providing critical information to
                                    quickly detect and address issues before they have a major impact. With the
                                    implementation of this DevOps methodology, we managed to accelerate application
                                    delivery, improve quality, and be responsive to system-wide improvement needs on the
                                    KarsaJobs and Ecommerce application management projects.

                                <p>Trans UPN is a website developed for transport management. This website is designed
                                    to facilitate transport management by involving drivers in the process. Through
                                    Trans UPN, drivers will receive a task to cover a certain distance and get a result
                                    or income that corresponds to the length of the distance covered in kilometres. In
                                    addition, Trans UPN also provides a revenue filter feature per day with different
                                    driver data. This allows users to view and analyse the daily revenue of each driver
                                    separately. This feature helps management in evaluating driver performance, as well
                                    as making it easier to monitor and manage payroll efficiently.</p>

                                    FIFADVENTURE is a UI/UX design project that uses Figma application to create an
                                    attractive user interface and intuitive user experience. The app is designed
                                    specifically for tent rental, with users using the mobile app to browse the tent
                                    catalogue, checkout, and receive notifications on the rental status. On the admin
                                    side, there is a website that allows rental management, including viewing orders,
                                    managing stock, and sending rental confirmations to users. With good design,
                                    FIFADVENTURE aims to provide a pleasant experience for users and simplify the tent

                                <p>In the final project on network topology using Packet Tracer application, we faced
                                    the challenge of setting up an effective connection between two different routers
                                    with various devices and different IP addresses. Our goal was to ensure that the IP
                                    addresses and IP gateways were interconnected so that communication could occur
                                    smoothly.</p>
                                <p>To achieve this, we used the IP configuration on each device and set the routing
                                    appropriately. We connected the devices to both routers using a network cable and
                                    set the appropriate IP addresses. Next, we used the IP route command to ensure that
                                    the connected IP address could communicate with other devices through different
                                    routers. With these settings in place, we were able to successfully send a ping from
                                    device 1 through a different router, ensuring good connectivity in our network
                                    topology.</p>
